# MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
# We want to get some information about the system. We can do this
# by asking for its identifier.
keithley.query('*IDN?')

# There are two ways to do this - the first is to use a single query
# command, which writes and then reads. The second is to explicitly
# write a command and then read out the data buffer.
#keithley.write('*IDN?')
#while True:
#    print(keithley.read_bytes(1))

# first, reset the equipment
print(keithley.write("*RST"))

# now, set the current and voltage ranges to what we want
print(keithley.write("configure:current"))

# Now, apply a voltage. I have no idea how to do this.

# Now, reconfigure the device to record voltage instead of current
# print(keithley.write("configure:voltage"))

# Now that we have configured out device to measure current, 
# we want to set up the voltage source. We do this through the 
# 'source' commands. 

# Sets the voltage source to a value of 2V
keithley.write('source:voltage:level 0.5')

# However, now we still need to turn on the voltage source. 

# Now, read some data
print(keithley.query("read?"))

# This is equivalent to this:
print(keithley.write('initiate'))
print(keithley.query('fetch?'))


# So it looks like the "fetch" query command grabs the latest
# post-processed data (I assume that means filtered data)
# Now the question is, what are these five numbers it gives me?
# One of them may be time.

# Apparently executing fetch actually does nothing to the sample buffer.
# So executing fetch multiple times will yield the same data, as I have
# seen. It also looks like fetch will grab all the data, which they
# claim is voltage, current, resistance, timestamp, and status. Not sure
# which of these numbers is which. 

# Now, read some (new) data. This apparently does an initiate 
# followed by a fetch. The initiate performs a new measurement cycle,
# and fetch grabs that.

# I believe the data block is Voltage, Current, Resistance (?), 
# Time, Status(?).

# We can also get statistics with calculate3, but it's not clear how to
# do this. 

# Here, we can set the filter to be a moving average
print(keithley.write('sense:average:tcontrol moving'))

# With a moving average sample count of 100
print(keithley.write('sense:average:count 10'))

# Now, we just need to figure out how to 

# Turn off the voltage source 
# keithley.write('source:clear:immediate')

# Now, we just need to figure out how to adjust the voltage/current limit.
# This is how it is done.
